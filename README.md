# Project 1 mmp224

## Milestone 1 questions:
### What are at least 3 technical issues you encountered with your project? How did you fix them?
- When trying to fetch the json data for an artists, I initially kept recieving an error with status 401 and it took me some time to realize that I had to get something called and OAuth Token, which ended up fixing the issue.
- And speaking of fetching the json data, in order to print specifics like the song name, artists name, etc. the json that I printed to check was not at all readable to the eyes, and not formatted correctly. I fixed the problem by writing the json data to a random text file so that I could look at it in a proper format. 
- And lastly, although it seems to be a little issue that occured since homework 4 I'd still like to point it out, that just saving the css file doesn't make changes to the final result. In order to fix the issue I kept having to rename the css file in order for the changes to show up. 

### What are known problems (still existing), if any, with your project?
- None

### What would you do to improve your project in the future?
- At this point after completing milestone 1, the main thing to improve would be how the html page looks. Making it pleasing to the eye with better placement, font, and a message telling the user there's no audio preview if it seems to be the case.

### Setting up the project:
- All files in the main branch help with building this project but what's not shows is the .env file, which helps save your API Key from being stolen. In order to do that, create the .env file and inside it add these lines of code:
export CLIENT_ID = 'APIKEY'
export CLIENT_SECRET = 'APIKEY'
- And where it says APIKEY, add your own key by following the steps of creating a developer account on https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/
